# Architecture Decision Record

## Introduction

An Architecure Decision Record is a document that captures architecturally significant decisions made during the development of a project.  A decision can be represented by such choices as language used, tooling, and individual features.  These documents are not meant to be defining, but reflective.  They will reflect a definitive title, clear context, simple declaration of the decision being made, the status, and reflective consequences of that decision.  Usually ADR documents are only one to two pages in length and are presented as a conversation and less of strict documentation.  For the purposes of organization, these documents will live apart from the individual projects.  

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to collect a sort of "in progress" architecture and design documentation for other projects I may be working on.  As I move away from isolated repositories into defining larger interconnected systems, I'd like to formalize design decisions via documentation here.  This is a first draft of defining the thought process I use for solving problem spaces in my "open-source" software.

## Implementation

ADRs contained here will be in [Markdown Architectural Decision ](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format for clear and easy reading and for quick rendering in Github.
